Hi there, I’m Atharva 👋. Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

*Drop an email at <a href="mailto:atharvaaingle@gmail.com" target="_blank">atharvaaingle@gmail.com</a> for freelancing projects/consultancy.*

At work, I'm a Data Scientist II at Wolters Kluwer, diving deep into Document AI and LLMs 🤖. Lately, my focus has shifted towards AI agents – not just chasing the hype, but genuinely figuring out where they can make a real impact in our company. I also occasionally write technical reports for Weights & Biases on the side.

Outside work, you’ll find me competing on Kaggle. I just love the adrenaline rush! 🚀 Since Kaggle represents the intersection of my field of interest and competitiveness, it provides the perfect platform for me. (Yes, I burn a looooot of GPU credits for it – happy if someone sponsors it! :D).

Before the AI bug bit quite so hard, I was pretty deep into gaming 🎮 – played a bit of everything, really, but especially loved FIFA on the PlayStation. I still squeeze in some game time occasionally when I can.

So, what's this blog for? It's basically my attempt to make sense of it all – sharing projects, things I'm learning, maybe the occasional rant, and posts about other random topics that grab my interest (though, fair warning, expect a lot of AI content). Think of it as my journey, documented 📝.

Pull up a chair, let's learn something together. Glad you stopped by! 😄
