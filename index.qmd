I‚Äôm Atharva, a Machine Learning Engineer focused on LLMs, RAG and AI agents. I like building things that ship, writing what I learn, and competing on Kaggle for fun. This site collects my notes, projects, and occasional essays. See my [about page](about.qmd) to read about my past work in much detail. Also check out [my blog](blogs.qmd) where I write about what I learn occasionally.

### üì∞ News
- [Participated in WSDM Cup - Multilingual Chatbot Arena on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/wsdm-cup-multilingual-chatbot-arena/overview): **Earned a solo silver medal placing 31st out of 950 teams**. Challenge was to develop a reward model (used in RLHF stage) for multilingual human conversations on the chatbot arena (formerly LMSYS). Read details about my solution [here](https://github.com/Gladiator07/WSDM-Cup-2025-Kaggle).

**What I am doing lately**

- I am diving deep into distributed learning
- I am exploring AI agents and looking where they can be genuinely used.

### üè¢ Who I'm working with currently

#### **Wolters Kluwer (Jan 2023 - Present): Machine Learning Engineer**: 
- I mostly work on Document AI for legal and financial workflows. I‚Äôve shipped multiple LLM/RAG services to production and am currently exploring where agents are genuinely useful in our products.
- **Recent work that I'm proud of:** Successfully instruction tuned a Qwen-2.5-VL model to extract structured information from billions of scanned images of very complex and different formats and deployed the complete system to production. This project involved preparing training data from scratch, establishing evals, fine-tuning the model, and implementing robust production serving infrastructure.

#### **Weights & Biases (May 2022 - Present): Ambassador**: 
- Writing technical reports and educational content for the community, turning new research and tools into simple, working examples and teach the ML community how to use them and demonstrate best practices with W&B platform.
- Engineering optimized Kaggle notebooks with added support for W&B tracking and monitoring tools.
