    "text": "I was just watching a Sentdex video and found out this pretty cool example on where we could use Pipeline Parallelism on his Jetson Thor which has a slow bandwith typically compared to a production GPU. This is a really good example of it. Here’s what was the moat of that approach:\n\nBottleneck: The Jetson Thor’s low memory bandwidth (273 GB/s) caused per-request latency (~500 ms) in the MoonDream 2 VLM, limiting throughput to about 2 FPS. It wasn’t compute or networking; “we know the bottleneck is the memory bandwidth.”\nFix (pipeline-style parallelism): He exploited the large 128 GB memory by running many independent VLM servers in parallel (each ~5 GB). Frames were interleaved across servers (1,3,5… to server A; 2,4,6… to server B; etc.). This keeps single-frame latency the same but increases overall frame throughput.\nResult: Doubling servers doubled FPS; 10 servers ≈ 20 FPS; 15 servers ≈ 30 FPS, with high GPU utilization (often 90%+). Trade-off: fewer headroom for other models, but you can tune server count."

    "text": "vLLM V0 + Prefix Caching on 2×T4: Why merged weights hung but LoRA didn’t\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nYour freeze was a V0 engine + TP&gt;1 + prefix caching interaction under tight VRAM. Turning enable_prefix_caching=False removed that path.\nWith merged weights, the engine reused one giant shared-prefix KV cache across thousands of requests; the V0 scheduler/block-manager then ran out of allocatable KV blocks and stalled. With LoRA, caches are namespaced per adapter, so that aggressive sharing path wasn’t taken, avoiding the stall.\n\n\n\n\nWhat prefix caching is doing in vLLM\n\nPrefix caching stores KV-cache blocks for a shared prompt prefix so later requests can skip prefill for those tokens; it’s implemented via block hashing + LRU over KV blocks.\nIn V0/V1 design notes and RFCs, cached KV blocks are treated like an OS cache: blocks are retained instead of freed and tracked in a global structure for reuse.\n\n\n\n\nWhy merged weights + prefix caching froze on your run\n\nScheduler blind spot (V0 path):\nIn V0, the scheduler decides whether it can allocate all KV blocks for a sequence before it accounts for which blocks are already cached. So even when most of your long prefix is cacheable, the scheduler may still demand a large number of free blocks up front. With thousands of identical prompts, this starves the block manager and the run stalls.\nTight VRAM → no headroom:\nvLLM pre-allocates KV blocks up to a fraction of GPU memory (gpu_memory_utilization). With 16 GiB T4s, TP&gt;1, long context, and high utilization, the pool has little slack; coupled with (1), you hit a deadlock/starvation pattern (first request OK, then nothing). Lowering utilization or disabling prefix caching frees the pipeline.\nThis exact failure mode is known:\nMultiple reports show hangs/crashes when prefix caching is enabled, where “first request is fine, second returns nothing”. Disabling prefix caching or reducing memory pressure is the workaround.\n\n\n\n\nWhy LoRA didn’t show the problem (but merged weights did)\n\nWith multiple adapters, vLLM treats KV caches as separate per LoRA (cache keys include the adapter identity), so sequences using an adapter don’t reuse the base-model prefix cache. That reduces cache sharing pressure and avoids the problematic allocator/scheduler path on V0. After you merged LoRA → base, there’s one weight set again, so aggressive prefix reuse kicked in and exposed the stall.\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do on Kaggle 2×T4 (V0 engine)\n\nKeep enable_prefix_caching=False when you have a long, identical prompt and TP&gt;1.\nLeave VRAM headroom: gpu_memory_utilization≈0.80, trim max_model_len to what you actually need, and batch in small chunks (32–128 prompts per generate). These align with vLLM’s guidance to avoid KV-block starvation.\n\n\n\n\nNotes on V1 vs V0 (why you read conflicting advice)\n\nV1 reworked prefix caching data structures; it’s near-zero overhead and on by default in many builds, but you’re on T4 → V0 fallback, so you still hit the older scheduler/block-manager behavior. Some V1 docs even suggest toggling prefix caching/eager mode depending on model/backend. The takeaway: your hardware keeps you on V0, so use the V0-safe settings above.\n\n\n\n\nOne-line mental model\nMerged weights made all requests share one hot prefix cache → V0 scheduler demanded more free KV blocks than available → starvation. LoRA segmented caches by adapter → less reuse → no starvation."
